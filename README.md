# UDP-connection-between-multi-client-and-server
The problem is to implement a client - server user-level application using sockets API in python. The Server application has to support at least five clients simultaneously. Server accepts strings from clients (even multiple strings from each client) and replies with reverse strings. For example, when client sends IITHYD, Server replies with DYHTII. Both server and client(s) have to output both sending &amp; receiving strings on the terminal. The server and client processes should be run on different machines. During evaluation, you will be asked to setup up to 5 client processes on different machines and show the outputs.
